Planning, in general, consists of computing a sequence of actions which, starting in an initial state or states, will achieve a set of goal states. Classical planning, then, is a constrained planning task, which is fully observable, deterministic, finite, static (i.e. the world does not change unless the agent acts), and discrete (i.e. time, actions, objects and effects are not continuous). Nonclassical planning, by contrast, is used to describe planning in partially observable or stochastic environments.

\subsubsection{Difficulties of Classical Planning}

Typical problem-solving agents which make use of standard search algorithms (i.e. depth-first, breadth-first, $A^*$, etc) encounter several difficulties when solving classical planning problems; each of these must be kept in mind when designing a planning agent. First of all, the agent may be overwhelmed by ``irrelevant'' actions (that is, actions which do not necessarily bring the agent closer to achieving a goal). There are multiple ways within the classical planning community of discouraging a planning agent from considering irrelevant actions; the use of regression search, for example, is one way to attempt to handle this problem. 

Another difficulty in classical planning is finding a good heuristic function. Because a problem-solving agent would see the goal state only as a ``black box'' which is either true or false for a given state, it would require a new heuristic for each specific problem it encounters. A planning agent, however, may have access to a representation of the goal state as a conjunction of subgoals, in which case it can use a single domain-independent heuristic; namely, the number of unsatisfied conjuncts. 

Similarly, a problem-solving agent might be inefficient because of its inability to take advantage of problem decomposition. A planning agent which views a state as a conjunction of literals, however, might be able to decompose the goal into a conjunction of subgoals, and then attempt to find a plan to achieve each subgoal. There are tradeoffs to this approach, however. Even if a planning agent can work on subgoals independently, some additional work may be required to combine the resultant subplans. Additionally, for some domains, on one subgoal may undo another.

\subsubsection{Representing Classical Planning Problems}

Classical planning problems are represented using three formalisms: states, goals and actions. These constructs form the basis of the languages used to encode planning problems in such a way that planners can understand them and operate on them to search for plans.
